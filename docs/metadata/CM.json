    "survey_description": "The following is a definition of: Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (CM)\n\nSurvey Description: The Employer Costs for Employee Compensation (ECEC) is a measure\nof the cost of labor. The compensation series includes wages and salaries plus employer\ncosts for individual employee benefits. Employee benefit costs are calculated as cost-\nper-hour-worked for individual benefits ranging from employer payments for Social\nSecurity to paid time off for holidays.\n\nThe survey covers all occupations in the civilian economy, which includes the total\nprivate economy (excluding farms and households), and the public sector (excluding the\nfederal government). Statistics are published for the private and public sectors\nseparately, and the data are combined in a measure for the civilian economy.\n\nThe data are collected from a probability sample of about 27,200 occupations with 6,600\nsample establishments in private industry and about 8,000 occupations within 1,400\nstate and local government establishments. The sample establishments are classified in\nindustry categories based on the North American Industrial Classification System\n(NAICS). Within an establishment, specific job categories are selected to represent\nbroader occupational definitions. Jobs are classified according to the Standard\nOccupational Classification (SOC) system.\n\nSummary Data Available: For private industry workers, data are\navailable for total compensation costs, for wages and salaries alone, and\nfor individual benefit costs alone. Data are available by major occupational\nand industry groups, as well as by census region, census division, and bargaining\nstatus. Annual estimates of the 15 largest metropolitan areas are published for the\nMarch reference for total compensation, wages and salaries, as well as total benefits.\n\nFor state and local government and civilian workers data are available for major\noccupational and selected industry series.\n\nFrequency of Observations: Data are available on a quarterly basis.\n\nData Characteristics: All costs per hour worked are published to the nearest\ncent. All percents are published to one decimal place (including relative standard\nerrors).\n\nUpdating Schedule: Updates are available about ten weeks following the end\nof the reference period. Reference periods are the months of March, June, September,\nand December.",
