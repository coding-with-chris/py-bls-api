    "survey_description": "The following is a definition of:  CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - All Urban Consumers (CU)\n\nSurvey Description: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure\nof change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major\nexpenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and\nmedical care--typically purchased by urban consumers. Essentially, it\ncompares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a\nspecific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an\nearlier reference period. This reference period is designated as the base\nperiod.\n\nThe CPI publishes indexes for two\npopulations; all urban consumers (CU) and urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW).\n\nTo construct the two indexes, thousands of prices for commodities and services purchased by consumers\nare collected in a sample of 75 urban places. Rent data is collected in a separate sample of thousands\nof rental units. Comparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative\nchange over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used\nto measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.\n\nSummary Data Available: U.S. average indexes for both populations are\navailable for several hundred consumer items and groups of items. In addition,\nmany of the indexes have been adjusted for seasonality. The indexes are monthly. Different indexes\ngo back to different years, with the earliest, including all items, dating to  1913. Semi-annual\nindexes have been calculated for many items for comparison with\nsemi-annual areas mentioned below. Semi-annual indexes are available from 1984 forward.\n\nArea indexes for both populations are available for 23 urban places. For\neach area, indexes are published for a subset of items and groups. The indexes\nare published monthly for three areas and bimonthly for twenty areas. Regional and division level\nindexes for both populations are available for a subset of items and groups published. Indexes are\npublished for four regions and nine divisions. Regional indexes date to 1966; divisional indexes\nare newer, dating to 2018. Indexes are monthly, with  Semi-annual indexes\nalso calculated for selected items.\n\nCity-size class indexes for both populations are available for two size classes\nwith a similar subset of groups and items.\nRegion/city-size indexes (for example, Midwest size class B/C)for both populations are also available monthly.\n\nFrequency of Observations: U.S. city average indexes, regional indexes,\ndivision  indexes, size class indexes, and three metro area indexes are monthly. 20 metro area indexes are bimonthly.\n\nAnnual Averages: Annual averages are available for all unadjusted series\nin the CW and CU.\n\nBase Periods: Most indexes have a base period of 1982-1984 = 100.  Other\nindexes, mainly newer indexes, are based more recently.  The base period value is generally 100.0,\nwith rare exceptions where the base is set to 1000 to avoid loss of precision. The index\nfor the \"Purchasing Power\" values (AAOR and SAOR) have a base period value of 1.000.\n\nData Characteristics: Indexes are published to three decimal places.\n\nUpdating Schedule:  Updates become available with the release of new data, typically between the 10th and 14th of the month\nfollowing the reference month.",
