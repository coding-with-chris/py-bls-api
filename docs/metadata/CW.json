    "survey_description": "The following is a definition of: CONSUMER PRICE INDEX - All Urban Wage earners and clerical workers (CW)\n\nSurvey Description: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistical measure\nof change, over time, of the prices of goods and services in major\nexpenditure groups--such as food, housing, apparel, transportation, and\nmedical care--typically purchased by urban consumers.  Essentially, it\ncompares the cost of a sample \"market basket\" of goods and services in a\nspecific month relative to the cost of the same \"market basket\" in an\nearlier reference period.  This reference period is designated as the base\nperiod.\n\nThe CPI publishes indexes for two\npopulations; urban wage earners and clerical workers (CW), and all urban\nconsumers (CU).\n\nTo construct the two indexes, thousands of prices for commodities and services purchased by consumers\nare collected in a sample of 75 urban places. Rent data is collected in separate sample of thousands of rental units.\nComparison of indexes for individual CMSA's or cities show only the relative\nchange over time in prices between locations. These indexes cannot be used\nto measure interarea differences in price levels or living costs.\n\nSummary Data Available: U.S. average indexes for both populations are\navailable for several hundred  consumer items and groups of items. In addition,\nmany of the indexes have been adjusted for seasonality.  The indexes\nare monthly. Different indexes go back to different years, with the earliest, including all items,\ndating to  1913. Semi-annual indexes have been\ncalculated for many items for comparison with semi-annual areas\nmentioned below. Semi-annual indexes are available from 1984 forward.\n\nArea indexes for both populations are available for 23 urban places. For\neach area, indexes are published for a subset of items and groups. The indexes\nare published monthly for three areas and bimonthly for twenty areas. Regional and division level\nindexes for both populations are available for a subset of items and groups published. Indexes are published\nfor four regions and nine divisions. Regional indexes date to 1966; divisional indexes are newer, dating to 2018.\nIndexes are monthly, with Semi-annual indexes\nalso calculated for selected  items.\n\nCity-size class indexes for both populations are available for two size classes\nwith a similar subset of groups and items\nRegion/city-size indexes (for example, Midwest size class B/C)for both populations are also available monthly.\n\nFrequency of Observations:  U.S. city average indexes, regional indexes,\ndivision indexes, size class indexes, and three metro area indexes are monthly. 20 metro area indexes are bimonthly.\n\nAnnual Averages: Annual averages are available for all unadjusted series\nin the CW and CU.\n\nBase Periods: Most indexes have a base period of 1982-1984 = 100. Other\nindexes, mainly newer indexes, are based more recently.  The base period value is generally 100.0,\nwith rare exceptions where the base is set to 1000 to avoid loss of precision. The index\nfor the \"Purchasing Power\" values (AAOR and SAOR) have a base period value of 1.000.\n\nData Characteristics: Indexes are published to three decimal places.\n\nUpdating Schedule:  Updates become available with the release of new data, typically between the 10th and 14th of the month\nfollowing the reference month.",
