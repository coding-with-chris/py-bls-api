    "survey_description": "The following is a definition of: Marital and family labor force statistics from the Current Population Survey (FM)\n\nThe Current Population Survey (CPS), frequently referred to as the household survey, is a monthly survey of about 60,000 eligible households.\nThe CPS provides information about the civilian noninstitutional population age 16 years and over. All persons are classified as employed,\nunemployed, or not in the labor force. (See definitions of these and other key concepts in Section 2.)\n\nThe CPS estimates are available by various demographic characteristics, including age, sex, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and\nmarital status. Numerous cross-tabulations of labor force variables by demographic and labor force characteristics are available.\n\nThe survey is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Each month, typically during the calendar week including\nthe 19th day, Census interviewers contact households by telephone and in person and ask questions regarding the labor market activity\nof household members during the previous calendar week which included the 12th day of the month.\n\nStatistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than an entire population, is surveyed,\nthere is a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values they represent. The exact difference, or sampling error,\nvaries depending on the particular sample selected, and this variability is measured by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a\n90-percent chance, or level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from the true\npopulation value because of sampling error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of the\npopulation, inability to obtain information for all respondents in the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct\ninformation, and errors made in the collection or processing of data.\n\nReferences:\tBLS Handbook of Methods, Chapter 1, \"Labor force data derived from the Current Population Survey.\"\n\t\thttp://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/homch1_a.htm.\n\t\tAdditional technical documentation is available at http://www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm.",
