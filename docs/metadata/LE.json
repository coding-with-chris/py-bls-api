    "survey_description": "The following is a definition of: Weekly and hourly earnings data from the Current Population Survey (LE)\n\nSection 1 (Earnings)\n\nSurvey Description:  The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a sample survey of\nthe population 16 years of age and over.  The survey is conducted each month by\nthe U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and provides comprehensive\ndata on the labor force, the employed, and the unemployed, classified by such\ncharacteristics as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation,\nand industry attachment. The information is collected by trained interviewers\nfrom a sample of about 60,000 households located in 754 sample areas. These areas\nare chosen to represent all counties and independent cities in the United States,\nwith coverage in 50 States and the District of Columbia. The data collected\nare based on the activity or status reported for the calendar week including\nthe 12th of the month.\n\nSummary Data Available:  Earnings data are available for all workers, with data\navailable by age, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, sex, occupation, usual\nfull- or part-time status, educational attainment, and other characteristics.\n\nFrequency of Observations:  Quarterly averages, not seasonally adjusted.\n\nAnnual Averages:  Annual averages are available for all series.\n\nData Characteristics:  The earnings data are collected from one-quarter of the\nCPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers. All self-employed\nworkers are excluded.  Most series pertain to workers who usually work full time\non their sole or primary job.\n\nData represent earnings before taxes and other deductions, and include any overtime\npay, commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job, in the case of multiple\njobholders). Earnings reported on a basis other than weekly (for example, annual,\nmonthly, hourly) are converted to weekly.  The term \"usual\" is as perceived by the\nrespondent. If the respondent asks for a definition of usual, interviewers are\ninstructed to define the term as more than half the weeks worked during the past\n4 or 5 months. Data refer to wage and salary workers (excluding all self-employed\npersons regardless of whether their businesses were incorporated).\n\nMedian earnings figures indicate the value that divides the earnings distribution into\ntwo equal parts, one part having values above the median and the other having values\nbelow the median. The medians shown are calculated by linear interpolation of the $50\ncentered interval within which each median falls. Data expressed in constant dollars\nare deflated by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).\n\nUpdating Schedule:  Updates are usually available with the issuance of the quarterly\nusual weekly earnings news release. Annual average data are available in the fourth\nquarter news release.\n\nReferences:  Employment and Earnings, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics",
