The survey is conducted each month by\nthe U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics and provides comprehensive\ndata on the labor force, the employed, and the unemployed, classified by such\ncharacteristics as age, sex, race, family relationship, marital status, occupation,\nand industry attachment.  The information is collected by trained interviewers\nfrom a sample of about 60,000 households located in 754 sample areas.  These areas\nare chosen to represent all counties and independent cities in the United States,\nwith coverage in 50 States and the District of Columbia.  The data collected\nare based on the activity or status reported for the calendar week including\nthe 12th of the month.\n\nSummary Data Available:  Union data are available for all workers, members of\nunions and represented by unions, with data available by age, race, Hispanic\nor Latino ethnicity, sex, occupation, industry, state, and full- or part-time status.\nMedian weekly earnings data are also available for members of unions, represented by\nunions and non-union with data available by age, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity,\nsex, occupation, industry and full- or part-time status.\n\nFrequency of Observations:  The union membership and earnings data are collected\nfrom one-quarter of the CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers.\nAll self-employed workers are excluded.\n\nAnnual Averages:  Annual averages are available for all series.\n\nData Characteristics:  Earnings data are measured in weekly earnings for full-time\nwage and salary workers.\n\nMedian earnings figures indicate the value that divides the earnings distribution\ninto two equal parts, one part having values above the median and the other having\nvalues below the median.  The medians shown are calculated by linear interpolation\nof the $50 centered interval within which each median falls.  Data expressed in\nconstant dollars are deflated by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U).\n\nUpdating Schedule:  Updates are usually available with the issuance of the union\nmembership news release.\n\nReferences:  Employment and Earnings, U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics",
