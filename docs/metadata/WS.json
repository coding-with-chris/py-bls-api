    "survey_description": "The following is a definition of:  WORK STOPPAGE DATA (WS)\n\nSurvey Description:  The series covers all work stoppages--strikes and\nlockouts--involving 1,000 workers or more and lasting one full shift or\nlonger.  The Bureau does not attempt to differentiate between strikes and\nlockouts.  The series does not measure the indirect or secondary effect of\nstoppages on other establishments whose employees are idled by material\nshortages or lack of services.  For the series, a stoppage is considered\nto be ended when the number of workers involved dips below 1,000.\n\nThe series presents annual data from 1947 through 1981 and annual and\nmonthly data thereafter; it is not comparable with the one terminated in\n1981 that covered stoppages involving six workers or more.\n\nSummary Data Available:  The number of stoppages beginning in the period.\n\nThe number of stoppages in effect in the period, comprising those that\nbegan in the period and those that began earlier and continued into the\nperiod.\n\nThe number of workers directly involved in stoppages beginning in the\nperiod.\n\nThte number of workers directly involved in stoppages in effect in the\nperiod.\n\nThe total number of workdays lost by workers directly involved in the\nstoppages in effect in the period.\n\nTotal workdays lost in the stoppages in effect, as a percent of the number\nof workdays in the period multiplied by total national employment in the\nperiod.  (Private household, forestry, and fishery employees are excluded\nfrom total national employment.)\n\nFrequency of Observations:  Monthly in all cases.\n\nAnnual Averages:  Annual data are available.\n\nData Characteristics:  All percent changes are stored with one decimal\nplace.\n\nUpdating Schedule:  Updates become available about 3 weeks after the end of\neach month.  All monthly figures are preliminary until final monthly and\nannual figures are issued in February.\n\nReferences:\tBLS Handbook of Methods, Chapter 27, \"Work Stoppages\",\n\t\tBulletin 1910 (1976).",
